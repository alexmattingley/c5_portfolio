### Bootstrap Grid Based Portfolio

The aim of this project is twofold:

- To get you started with Bootstrap for rapid development
- To set the foundations for your portfolio website

#### Scope (Version 0.5)

1. Create a grid based layout for your website
  1. It should incorporate:
    - responsive breakpoints at all levels (xs-lg col's)
    - a contact form for your contact page utilizing Bootstrap classes
  2. Minimum pages:
    - index homepage
    - an "about page" or portfolio section
    - a contact page containing your responsive form
2. Since this is only the foundation you are free to choose the basic setup
3. Each page must at least have:
    - a head section containing your responsive navigation
    - a main body section comprised of at least 1 image/banner and 1 text section
    - a footer containing links to your accounts (doesn't have to be functional)
4. This is a prototype draft so don't worry about overcommitting yourself in one direction

				<p>My name is Alex, but some of my friends like to call me goggles. I am a web developer living in San Diego California. My life outside of web development consists of lots of tea drinking, traveling to Mexico and surfing with Friends and Family. If you want to see a little bit more of my work check out the work tab up above. If you want to get in touch with me, send me a message through the <a href="javascript:;">contact form</a>, i'll get back to you as soon as I get out out of the water.</p>
				<p>Cheers!</p>
				<p>- Alex</p>

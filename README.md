# c5_portfolio
####Make sure your portfolio files are included in a repo forked from this repo
### V2.0 scope:

- 1 "about me" section / page
  - include your name
  - include your github account link
  - include your linkedin profile link
  - include a link to your résumé in PDF form
  - include your email address
  - a short blurb about you
- 2 "contact me" section / page
  - include a form to send you a message through your site (doesn't not have to go anywhere yet)
- 3 "skills" section / page
  - include your pertinent LF related skills
  - skills from previous jobs that you believe are relevant to your CS future (such as leadership, teambuilding, technical / achievement related skills
- 4 "projects" section / page
  - include your LF / personal projects that illustrate your growth as a programmer
  - apps you have made at LF must be testable and displayed or linked through your project section. JS/HTML only apps  can be hosted on github pages
  
General requirements:
- Must have some sort of CSS / JS roll-over effect for your projects section
- Must have JS code to prevent spam-scraping of your email address.
  - Do this by not including your email address directly in your HTML, but instead adding it to the relevant section on page load
  - email address must be composited from 2 variables, one holding your name, one holding the email server, for example:
    - var e_name = 'daniel.paschal';
    - var e_server = '@learningfuze.com';
- Must be responsive and mobile-friendly.  Probably best to use bootstrap!

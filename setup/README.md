### Basic Setup Guide & First Task Submission

Basic setup documentation is found in the /Prep-Work Wiki on the Learning-Fuze master branch. Once you have completed all of your basic setup items and have gone through some of the first tutorials, your last step is to complete a basic set of tasks designed to get you working with the workflow and material. It does not count towards the official course material but it will help you hit the ground running on Monday.

### Setup Task Steps:

1. Start with the setup task in the setup folder: __Prep-Work/setup/setup_task.md__
2. Work through sets 1-5 (update status with commit message/task)
3. Submit your first pull request __`"setup items & tasks completed"`__
4. Pull request deadline: __8:00pm, Sunday 6/21__
